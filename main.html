	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
  Time complexity tells us how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size (n) increases.
  Itâ€™s not the exact time in seconds, but a way to compare how efficient algorithms are.
</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures how much extra memory (RAM) an algorithm uses as the input size (n) grows.</p>
